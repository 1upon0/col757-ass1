OpenMP implementation of parallel OR, batcher's merge sort and partition sort  

1. Compute the OR of a million bits using the following two algorithms and compare the parallel time.
    - Use concurrent writes into some common memory location
    - Use the binary tree method.
2. Implement parallel mergesort and partition sort and compare them in terms of running times and total number of comparisons.
